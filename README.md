# spLAMP (dev version): Spatial modeling via Local Aggregate Multiscale Process (LAMP)
R codes for spatial prediction and uncertainty modeling using the Local Aggregate Multiscale Process (LAMP), a fast, validation-based spatial process model:
- lamp_functions.R: Main and internal functions
- sample_code.R   : Sample code for spatial prediction using meuse data

The R package spLAMP is currently under development and will be released on CRAN in near future, once additional functionality has been implemented.
